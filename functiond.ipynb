A function\\nis created so that one can use a block of code as many times as needed just by\\nusing the name of the function.\\nWhy Do We Need Functions?\\n● Reusability: Once a function is defined, it can be used over and over again.\\nYou can call the function as many times as it is needed. Suppose you are\\nrequired to find out the area of a circle for 10 different radii. Now, you can\\neither write the formula πr\\n2 10 times or you can simply create a function that\\ntakes the value of the radius as an input and returns the area corresponding\\nto that radius. This way you would not have to write the same code (formula)\\n10 times. You can simply invoke the function every time.\\n● Neat code: A code containing functions is concise and easy to read.\\n● Modularisation: Functions help in modularizing code. Modularization means\\ndividing the code into smaller modules, each performing a specific task.\\n● Easy Debugging: It is easy to find and correct the error in a function as\\ncompared to raw code.\\n1\\nDefining Functions In Python\\nA function, once defined, can be invoked as many times as needed by using its\\nname, without having to rewrite its code.\\nA function in Python is defined as per the following syntax:\\nde <function-name>(<parameters>):\\n Function\\'s docstring \\n<Expressions/Statements/Instructions>\\n● Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name\\nand parentheses ( ( ) ).\\n● The input parameters or arguments should be placed within these\\nparentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.\\n● The first statement of a function is optional - the documentation string of the\\nfunction or docstring. The docstring describes the functionality of a\\nfunction.\\n● The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.\\nAll statements within the same code block are at the same indentation level.\\n● The return statement exits a function, optionally passing back an\\nexpression/value to the function caller.\\nLet us define a function to add two numbers.\\ndef add(a,b):\\nreturn a+b\\nThe above function returns the sum of two numbers a and b.\\n2\\nThe return Statement\\nA return statement is used to end the execution of the function call and it “returns”\\nthe result (value of the expression following the return keyword) to the caller. The\\nstatements after the return statements are not executed. If the return statement is\\nwithout any expression, then the special value None is returned.\\nIn the example given above, the sum a+b is returned.\\nNote: In Python, you need not specify the return type i.e. the data type of returned\\nvalue.\\nCalling/Invoking A Function\\nOnce you have defined a function, you can call it from another function, program,\\nor even the Python prompt. To use a function that has been defined earlier, you\\nneed to write a function call.\\nA function call takes the following form:\\n<function-name> (<value-to-be-passed-as-argument>)\\nThe function definition does not execute the function body. The function gets\\nexecuted only when it is called or invoked. To call the above function we can write:\\nadd(5,7)\\nIn this function call, a = 5 and b = 7.\\n3\\nArguments And Parameters\\nAs you know that you can pass values to functions. For this, you define variables to\\nreceive values in the function definition and you send values via a function call\\nstatement. For example, in the add() function, we have variables a and b to receive\\nthe values and while calling the function we pass the values 5 and 7. We can define\\nthese two types of values:\\n● Arguments: The values being passed to the function from the function call\\nstatement are called arguments. Eg. 5 and 7 are arguments to the add()\\nfunction.\\n● Parameters: The values received by the function as inputs are called\\nparameters. Eg. a and b are the parameters of the add() function.\\nTypes Of Functions\\nWe can divide functions into the following two types:\\n1. User-defined functions: Functions that are defined by the users. Eg. The\\nadd() function we created.\\n2. Inbuilt Functions: Functions that are inbuilt in python. Eg. The print()\\nfunction.\\n4\\nScope Of Variables\\nAll variables in a program may not be accessible at all locations in that program.\\nPart(s) of the program within which the variable name is legal and accessible, is\\ncalled the scope of the variable. A variable will only be visible to and accessible by\\nthe code blocks in its scope.\\nThere are broadly two kinds of scopes in Python −\\n● Global scope\\n● Local scope\\nGlobal Scope\\nA variable/name declared in the top-level segment (__main__) of a program is said\\nto have a global scope and is usable inside the whole program (Can be accessed\\nfrom anywhere in the program).\\nIn Python, a variable declared outside a function is known as a global variable. This\\nmeans that a global variable can be accessed from inside or outside of the function.\\nLocal Scope\\nVariables that are defined inside a function body have a local scope. This means\\nthat local variables can be accessed only inside the function in which they are\\ndeclared.\\nThe Lifetime of a Variable\\nThe lifetime of a variable is the time for which the variable exists in the memory.\\n● The lifetime of a Global variable is the entire program run (i.e. they live in the\\nmemory as long as the program is being executed).\\n● The lifetime of a Local variable is their function’s run (i.e. as long as their\\nfunction is being executed).\\n5\\nCreating a Global Variable\\nConsider the given code snippet:\\nx = \"Global Variable\"\\ndef foo():\\nprint(\"Value of x: \", x)\\nfoo()\\nHere, we created a global variable x = \"Global Variable\". Then, we created a\\nfunction foo to print the value of the global variable from inside the function. We\\nget the output as:\\nGlobal Variable\\nThus we can conclude that we can access a global variable from inside any function.\\nWhat if you want to change the value of a Global Variable from inside a\\nfunction?\\nConsider the code snippet:\\nx = \"Global Variable\"\\ndef foo():\\nx = x -1\\nprint(x)\\nfoo()\\nIn this code block, we tried to update the value of the global variable x. We get an\\noutput as:\\nUnboundLocalError: local variable \\'x\\' referenced before assignment\\nThis happens because, when the command x=x-1, is interpreted, Python treats this\\nx as a local variable and we have not defined any local variable x inside the function\\nfoo().\\n6\\nCreating a Local Variable\\nWe declare a local variable inside a function. Consider the given function definition:\\ndef foo():\\ny = \"Local Variable\"\\nprint(y)\\nfoo()\\nWe get the output as:\\nLocal Variable\\nAccessing A Local Variable Outside The Scope\\ndef foo():\\ny = \"local\"\\nfoo()\\nprint(y)\\nIn the above code, we declared a local variable y inside the function foo(), and\\nthen we tried to access it from outside the function. We get the output as:\\nNameError: name \\'y\\' is not defined\\nWe get an error because the lifetime of a local variable is the function it is defined\\nin. Outside the function, the variable does not exist and cannot be accessed. In\\nother words, a variable cannot be accessed outside its scope.\\n7\\nGlobal Variable And Local Variable With The Same Name\\nConsider the code given:\\nx = 5\\ndef foo():\\nx = 10\\nprint(\"Local:\", x)\\nfoo()\\nprint(\"Global:\", x)\\nIn this, we have declared a global variable x = 5 outside the function foo(). Now,\\ninside the function foo(), we re-declared a local variable with the same name, x.\\nNow, we try to print the values of x, inside, and outside the function. We observe\\nthe following output:\\nLocal: 10\\nGlobal: 5\\nIn the above code, we used the same name x for both global and local variables.\\nWe get a different result when we print the value of x because the variables have\\nbeen declared in different scopes, i.e. the local scope inside foo() and global scope\\noutside foo().\\nWhen we print the value of the variable inside foo() it outputs Local: 10. This is\\ncalled the local scope of the variable. In the local scope, it prints the value that it has\\nbeen assigned inside the function.\\nSimilarly, when we print the variable outside foo(), it outputs global Global: 5.\\nThis is called the global scope of the variable and the value of the global variable x\\nis printed.\\n8\\nPython Default Parameters\\nFunction parameters can have default values in Python. We can provide a default\\nvalue to a parameter by using the assignment operator (=). Here is an example.\\ndef wish(name, wish=\"Happy Birthday\"):\\nThis function wishes the person with the provided message. If the\\nmessage is not provided, it defaults to \"Happy Birthday\" \\nprint(\"Hello\", name + \\', \\' + wish)\\ngreet(\"Rohan\")\\ngreet(\"Hardik\", \"Happy New Year\")\\nOutput\\nHello Rohan, Happy Birthday\\nHello Hardik, Happy New Year\\nIn this function, the parameter name does not have a default value and is required\\n(mandatory) during a call.\\nOn the other hand, the parameter wish has a default value of \"Happy Birthday\".\\nSo, it is optional during a call. If an argument is passed corresponding to the\\nparameter, it will overwrite the default value, otherwise it will use the default value.\\nImportant Points to be kept in mind while using default parameters:\\n● Any number of parameters in a function can have a default value.\\n● The conventional syntax for using default parameters states that once we\\nhave passed a default parameter, all the parameters to its right must also\\nhave default values.\\n● In other words, non-default parameters cannot follow default parameters.\\n9\\nFor example, if we had defined the function header as:\\ndef wish(wish = \"Happy Birthday\", name):\\n...\\nWe would get an error as:\\nSyntaxError: non-default argument follows default argument\\nThus to summarise, in a function header, any parameter can have a default value\\nunless all the parameters to its right have their default values.\\n\\n'"
